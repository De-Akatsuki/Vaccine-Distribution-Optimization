# Vaccine-Distribution-Optimization
Optimizing the allocation of scarce medical resources, such as vaccines, across various regions in Africa where healthcare systems face significant constraints

**Background:**
Healthcare systems in Africa often deal with limited resources and infrastructure. 
Efficiently allocating these resources can save lives, especially in regions with high 
population density and varying healthcare needs. Dynamic programming can 
provide an optimal solution by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more 
manageable subproblems.

### Lab Exercise 1: Vaccine Distribution Optimization
- Task: Develop a dynamic programming model to allocate vaccines efficiently across 
multiple regions with different population sizes, risk levels, and healthcare needs.
- Instructions: Consider constraints such as vaccine availability, transportation 
limitations, and regional healthcare infrastructure
